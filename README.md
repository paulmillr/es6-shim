# ES6 Shim
Provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines behave as
closely as possible to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony).

Project targets engines that support ES5 (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera). With
[ES5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) it could also work in older
browsers.

## Installation

    npm install es6-shim

Or just include es6-shim before your scripts if you want to use it in browser.

## Safe shims
* Maps & Sets
* String.prototype.repeat, String.prototype.startsWith,
String.prototype.endsWith, String.prototype.contains, String.prototype.toArray
* Array.from, Array.of
* Number.isNaN, Number.toInteger, Number.isInteger, Number.isFinite
* Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors, Object.getPropertyDescriptor,
Object.getPropertyNames, Object.is, Object.isnt
* Math.sign, Math.log10, Math.log2, Math.log1p, Math.expm1, Math.cosh,
Math.sinh, Math.tanh, Math.acosh, Math.asinh, Math.atanh, Math.hypot,
Math.trunc (accuracy is 1e-11).

## WeakMap shim
It is not possible to implement WeakMap in pure javascript.
[es6-collections](https://github.com/WebReflection/es6-collections)
implementation doesn't held values strongly which is critical
for the collection. es6-shim decided to not include incorrect shim.

WeakMap has very unusual use-case so you probably won't need it at all (
use simple `Map` instead).

es6-collections Map and Set are also implemented incorrectly and don't pass
all V8 collection tests.

## IE8 support
There are some shims that do not work in IE8, because it is simply not
possible to implement them properly:

* Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors, Object.getPropertyDescriptor, Object.getPropertyNames

## Getting started

```javascript
'abc'.startsWith('a') // true
'abc'.endsWith('a') // false
Object.is(NaN, NaN) // Fixes ===. 0 isnt -0, NaN is NaN
'123'.repeat(2)     // '123123'
'123'.toArray()     // ['1', '2', '3']
'john alice'.contains('john') // true
Number.isNaN('123') // false. isNaN('123') will give true.
Number.toInteger(2.4) // 2. converts values to IEEE754 double precision integers
// Tests if value is a number, finite,
// >= -9007199254740992 && <= 9007199254740992 and floor(value) === value
Number.isInteger(2.4) // false.
Number.isFinite('asd') // false. Global isFinite() will give true.
Math.sign(400) // 1, 0 or -1 depending on sign. In this case 1.

// Replacement for `{}` key-value storage.
// Keys can be anything.
var map = new Map()
map.set('John', 25)
map.set('Alice', 400)
map.set(['meh'], 555)
map.get(['meh']) // undefined because you need to use exactly the same object.
map.delete('Alice')

// Useful for storing unique items.
var set = new Set()
set.add(1)
set.add(5)
set.has(1)
set.has(4)  // => false
set.delete(5)
```
